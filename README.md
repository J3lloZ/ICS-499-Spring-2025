# FocusLock App

A productivity Android app designed for students who want to improve focus by limiting distractions during study time. Built as a capstone project for ICS 499 - Software Engineering, Spring 2025.

- **Custom Study Timer**: Users can select hours, minutes, and seconds to create their own focused session.
- **Single User Type**: Simplified experience â€” no multiple roles. Anyone can register and use the app.
- **Firebase Integration**: Stores user information securely in Firestore and supports login/logout.
- **Welcome Message**: Personalized welcome message based on your registered first name.
